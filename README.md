# Hydrogen-Rich Reservoir Mapping using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine learning and deep learning framework for the detection and mapping of potential natural hydrogen reservoirs in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. We leverage Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, synthetic geochemical features, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to generate high-resolution hydrogen prospectivity maps.

The project combines ensemble machine learning models and a customized U-Net convolutional neural network, validated through clustering and explainability methods such as Grad-CAM.

## Features

- **Remote Sensing Preprocessing:** NDVI, SWIR1 resampling, synthetic geochemical feature generation.

- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Ensemble stacking using Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, RidgeClassifier.

- **Deep Learning Segmentation:** Custom U-Net for pixel-wise hydrogen class prediction.

- **Explainability:** Grad-CAM interpretation of deep learning outputs.

- **Disagreement Analysis:** Raster difference maps and clustering (KMeans and DBSCAN) for anomaly detection.

- **Interactive Visualization:** Folium map overlays for results.

## Data

- Sentinel-2 Imagery: Copernicus Open Access Hub (2025 acquisition).

- Synthetic Geochemical Features: NDVI, SWIR1, Soil Temperature, Soil Moisture, Rock Type.

- Sample Data: Minimal dummy samples provided for reproducibility.

## Dataset Access

Due to size limitations, the full training dataset (hydrogen prediction geospatial files for Atyrau) is hosted externally.
